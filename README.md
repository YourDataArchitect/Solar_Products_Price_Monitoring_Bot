Solar Products Price Monitoring Bot Overview This project is a web scraping bot designed to extract and monitor prices from 14 different websites that sell solar energy products. The bot performs automated daily updates by extracting prices, monitoring new products, and storing data efficiently in both Google Sheets and a database. The bot is containerized using Docker, ensuring it runs in a consistent and isolated environment across different systems, making it easy to deploy and manage. Features Price Extraction: Automatically scrapes prices from 14 websites that sell solar energy products. Google Sheets Integration: Updates a specified Google Sheet with the latest prices for easy, real-time access. Database Storage: Stores product and pricing data in a structured database for historical tracking and analysis. New Product Monitoring: Detects and logs newly listed products on these websites. VPN Integration: Uses Surfshark VPN to rotate IP addresses, ensuring the bot remains anonymous and avoids IP blocks during web scraping. Docker Containerization: The entire project is packaged into a Docker container for consistent deployment and operation on any platform. Technology Stack Python for the web scraping logic and automation. Scrapy for handling scraping tasks across multiple websites. Google Sheets API to programmatically update the sheet with new data. PostgreSQL/MySQL for database storage and management of scraped data. Surfshark VPN for IP rotation, ensuring the scraping process is not blocked by anti-scraping measures on the websites. Docker for containerization, allowing the bot to run in a consistent, isolated environment and simplifying deployment. How It Works The bot visits each of the 14 websites at regular intervals to scrape product prices. It checks for any new products that have been added and records their details. Scraped data is processed and updated in a Google Sheet for quick access. The same data is also stored in a database to maintain a history of product prices. The bot runs inside a Docker container, ensuring it operates in the same environment across different systems, avoiding dependency issues. To avoid being detected and blocked, the bot uses Surfshark VPN to rotate IP addresses dynamically. Future Improvements Expand the bot to scrape from additional websites. Add data visualization tools for better insights into price trends. Optimize the VPN connection for smoother and faster scraping.
